# 🛡️ NIST Cybersecurity Vulnerability Dashboard

This project is a **Streamlit**-based interactive dashboard that visualizes and explores cybersecurity vulnerabilities from a processed NIST dataset.

It uses **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**, network analysis, and visualizations to provide insights into CVEs, severity levels, affected operating systems, attack vectors, software vulnerabilities, and relationships between entities.
